# Vanilla RTX
Vanilla RTX is the go-to ray tracing resource pack for Minecraft RTX, bringing together a solid, coherent vision for Vanilla Minecraft with RTX since 2020â€”Vanilla RTX allows you to use Minecraft's ray tracing features in your worlds and servers by adding thoughtfully crafted materials and configurations to the base game without altering the vanilla experience, delivering complete ray tracing support for Minecraft in a manner that integrates seamlessly while maintaining a native look and feel.

- Vanilla RTX uses 16x heightmaps with 192x normal maps generated based on height differences.
- Vanilla RTX Normals features handcrafted 16x normal maps instead.
- Every possible vanilla Creative mode, Education edition or even unobtainable block is covered!
- All blocks feature highly detailed, unique material designs that remain consistent across different blocks made of the same material.
- Everything has been fine-tuned for Minecraft's ray tracing.
- Vanilla PBR is a branch project of Vanilla RTX for Vibrant Visuals graphics mode usable on a wider range of hardware
